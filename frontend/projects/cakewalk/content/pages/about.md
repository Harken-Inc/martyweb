# About Cakewalk AEO

## The Future of Search Is Here

Search is changing faster than ever. Millions of people now ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini instead of typing into Google. When these AI systems answer, they cite sources—and that traffic has to go somewhere.

We built Cakewalk to capture it.

## What We Do

Cakewalk is an AI agent that handles your entire content and SEO workflow automatically:

- **Discovers** opportunities in AI search that your competitors are missing
- **Creates** content optimized to get cited by AI platforms
- **Publishes** directly to your site
- **Tracks** performance across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google
- **Optimizes** automatically based on what's working

No content calendars. No writer management. No SEO consultants. Just traffic that grows while you focus on your business.

## Why AEO (AI Engine Optimization)?

Traditional SEO is a grind. You're competing against millions of pages, waiting 6-12 months for results, and constantly managing content production.

AI Engine Optimization is different:

- **Almost no competition** — most businesses haven't figured this out yet
- **Fast results** — weeks, not months
- **Higher impact** — one AI citation can outperform being on page one of Google

We built the first platform that handles AEO end-to-end, automatically.

## Our Technology

Cakewalk combines several AI systems working together:

- **Discovery Engine** — Finds AI prompts and queries relevant to your business
- **Citation Tracker** — Monitors when you get cited by AI platforms (nobody else does this)
- **Content Generator** — Creates citation-optimized content at scale
- **Learning System** — Improves continuously based on collective results

The longer you run Cakewalk, the smarter it gets.

## The Team

We're a team of AI researchers, SEO veterans, and automation engineers who saw the shift to AI search coming. We built Cakewalk because we wanted to use it ourselves—and now we're sharing it with businesses ready to move early.
