## The Problem

SEO takes forever. AI search is exploding. You don't have time to figure out both. Now you don't have to.

---

## The Opportunity

### AI Search Is Wide Open. And Nobody's Optimizing For It.

Millions now ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini instead of Google. When AI answers, it cites sources—and that traffic goes somewhere.

- Almost nobody is optimizing for AI citations yet
- Results happen in weeks, not months
- One citation can outperform a page-one Google ranking

Cakewalk finds these opportunities and captures them for you. Automatically.

## Why AEO Is Faster

### Weeks to Results. Not Months.

|                      | Traditional SEO      | Cakewalk AEO                 |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Time to results**  | 6-12 months          | Weeks                        |
| **Competition**      | Millions of pages    | Almost nobody                |
| **Visibility per win**| One of 10 blue links | Often the only source cited  |
| **Effort**           | Constant             | Set and forget               |

SEO still matters—we do that too. But AEO is where the fast wins are.
